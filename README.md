Here is a demo of the application:
![Demo of website]("./React App.gif")

Each time the website is loaded, it will populate an employee directory with 50 random employees. Hovering over the table headers (Name, Phone, Email or DOB), a carrot will display in the appropriate colour and orientation to indicate whether the user can order in ascending or descending order for that column. By clicking on the heading, it will order the table accordingly. The user can also search by the name of the employee. The table will dynamically show employee whose names includes the search input.
